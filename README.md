<h1>Campus CourierðŸ“¦</h1>
<h2>Project OverviewðŸ“‘:</h2>

<b>Campus Courier is a student-centric app designed to streamline the acquisition of essential
items for SUTD students who are facing time constraints due to their demanding academic
workload, making it difficult for them to obtain essential items. Whether it's groceries,
household items, or project materials, students can post requests for essential items they
need. Other students can then accept these requests, purchase the items, and arrange for
delivery, providing an avenue for them to earn some side cash while helping their peers.

Users can seamlessly switch between roles as requestors and suppliers, each offering a
tailored user interface. Requestors benefit from real-time tracking of their posted requests,
while suppliers manage their accepted requests through a to-do checklist. Ensuring
accountability and reliability, both parties must confirm delivery to mark the request as
completed and archive it in the history section.

The app allows for efficient browsing through a search function based on string input and
filtering by location and category, streamlining the process of finding and fulfilling requests.
The app also incorporates a penalty system, allowing users to report non-cooperative
individuals, ensuring a safe environment.

Beyond its practical utility, Campus Courier cultivates a culture of mutual support and
collaboration among students, enriching the university experience and fostering a sense of
community within the SUTD campus.</b>
